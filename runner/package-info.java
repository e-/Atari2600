/**
 * This package contains GUI-related classes. 
 * These classes are separate from the core classes because they don't represent a vital 
 * component of the emulation...a new GUI class (in the same or different package)
 * would be able to run the emulator without using any of these classes.  The package
 * does contain classes like Intercessor and InputMaster, which contain methods and
 * management systems that would be beneficial to a GUI.
